# Graph Theory CT Repository

A collection of graph theory exercises and resources for grades Pre-K through 2 designed specifically to introduce and practice computational thinking skills to the littlest learners. We hope that over time this repository will grow with a diverse set of easy-to-run assignments that require little to no computer science background.

### CS Unplugged Activities
